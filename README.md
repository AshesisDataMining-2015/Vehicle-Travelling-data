Vehicle Travelling data during my work on my thesis.

I got this data from my database, I exported it.

I started my analysis with R but met a few Mac specific errors. Per the suggestion of my supervisor I began using the Rstudio hosted by Kpetermeni. Network connectivity became a hurdle and time was not a luxury i had, so i settled with GEPHI.

I employed Force Atlas 2 (enabliing 'prevent overlap')


Before moving on with depth analysis, i had a few questions in mind: 
I wanted to know if there was going to be any interesting pattern that would show up.
which road did i spend the longest time on? 


I did not do much programming analysis. however I spent some time with data cleaning in other to get crisp information.
