Vehicle Travelling data. 

I got this data from my database (which i used for my thesis), I exported it.

Before moving on with depth analysis, i had a few questions in mind, which will eventually guide me through this project: 
I wanted to know if there was going to be any interesting pattern that would show up.
which road did i spend the longest time on?  and which road had the sloweset traffic?

At the begining of this project I worked with R on my local mac book. However, randomly i kept walking into mac os x specific errors. Dr. Jackson advised I use the Rstudio Kpetermeni hosted on the Local Area Network. At the time the wireless connectivity was not at its best therefore my most stable option was Gephi (I employed Force Atlas 2 enabliing 'prevent overlap'). I also, used Excel to double check some of the information Gephi would present.I did not do much programming analysis but I spent some time with data cleaning in other to get crisp information. Some deletions were made; Deletions of ID column, Deletion of Traffic status column and Limited Entry data to 113 because my compouters memory is not huge.

 Prior to crunching, i had some presumptions in mind, I expected the road with the slowest traffic to be a bigger bubble than I expected. During crunching I made some observations; I should have deleted the DATE Column. The data colleceted was all done on the same day therefore the 'date' was one of teh biggest node and was at the core of the 'chaos'. However, since the data entries were made by the same phone i expected the cell phone model to also be as big as the 'date' node.
 
 At the end of this journey  answers came up for the questions genereated. These values are below.
 Which road had the slowest traffic? Ans: Airport By-pass Road, Accra

Which road did I spend the longest time? **  Ans: Airport Road

The '**' next to the second was there because the porbability of it having the same answer as the first is pretty high.
